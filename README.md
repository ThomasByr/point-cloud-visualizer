## ‚úèÔ∏è In short

This project is a simple GUI for visualizing point clouds using the [Open3d](http://www.open3d.org/) library. This tool is written in Python.

Just provide a `config.json` file (in a "data" directory for eg.) following the model :

```json
{
  "default": {
    "pattern": "{?},{x},{y},{z},{?},{?},{?},{id}",
    "skip_first_line": true
  },
  "configs": [
    {
      "file_path": "in/Adapter1.csv",
      "source_xyz": [700, 360, 100]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Then obviously, you will need the point clouds files in a text file format (csv, txt, etc.) with the corresponding format :

```csv
---,XCoordinate,YCoordinate,ZCoordinate,RColor,GColor,BColor,ObjectID
0,-200.857966,-0.472143,10.636364,25,42,72,19
1,-202.754359,-0.273832,11.529021,25,42,72,19
...
```

You do not explicitly need a conda environment for the bot to run. But it is always recommended nontheless, especially because the next LTS of Ubuntu won't let users pip-install anything without a virtual environment. At the time of writing, this app requires `python >= 3.10` to run.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:ThomasByr/point-cloud-visualizer.git
cd point-cloud-visualizer
```

You can create and activate a conda environment with the following commands :

```bash
# Create the environment and install the dependencies
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate o3d
```

Finally, run the app by typing the following :

```bash
# Run app
python pcv.py
```

## ‚öóÔ∏è Testing

Make sure you have installed the dependencies for testing :

```bash
# inside conda environment
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Then, run the tests with the following command :

```bash
hatch run dev:check
```

or more manually :

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m pylint src
python -m yapf -dr src
```
