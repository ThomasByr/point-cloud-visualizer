## ‚úèÔ∏è In short

This project is a simple GUI for visualizing raw-text point-clouds using the [Open3d](http://www.open3d.org/) library. It is meant to be used with a config file to load multiple point clouds at once. It also supports downsampling and saving the point cloud in a numpy array format.

Just provide a `config.json` file (supported schemes are json, jsonc, json5) following the model :

```json5
{
  "default": {
    "pattern": "{?},{x},{y},{z},{r},{g},{b},{id}",
    "skip_first_line": true
  },
  "configs": [
    {
      "file_path": "<path to file n¬∞1>.csv",
      "source_xyz": [<x1>, <y1>, <z1>]
    },
    {
      "file_path": "<path to file n¬∞2>.csv",
      "source_xyz": [<x2>, <y2>, <z2>]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Allowed fields for the `pattern` property are (`x`, `y`, `z` are mandatory) :

- `{?}` : anything we want to skip
- `{x}` : x coordinate of the point (float)
- `{y}` : y coordinate '''
- `{z}` : z coordinate '''
- `{r}` : red color component (int 0..=255)
- `{g}` : green color component '''
- `{b}` : blue color component '''
- `{X}` : the x coordinate of the source point (float)  (\*)
- `{Y}` : the y coordinate of the source point (float)
- `{Z}` : the z coordinate of the source point (float)
- `{id}` : id of the object (int)(\*\*)

(\*) _if one of `{X}`, `{Y}` or `{Z}` is specified, all of them must be_

(\*\*) _the id will be used to color the points in rendering if all color components are omitted_

`pattern` and `skip_first_line` fields can be overwritten in the `configs` array if needed. `source_xyz` is the position of the sensor in the scene and only `file_path` is not set by default

Then obviously, you will need the point clouds files in a text file format (csv, txt, etc.) with the corresponding format :

```csv
---,XCoordinate,YCoordinate,ZCoordinate,RColor,GColor,BColor,ObjectID
0,-200.857966,-0.472143,10.636364,25,42,72,19
1,-202.754359,-0.273832,11.529021,25,42,72,19
...
```

> Please note we do not officially support Windows or MacOS, but we do provide some instructions for those who want to use it on these platforms.

You do not explicitly need a conda environment for the app to run. But it is always recommended nontheless, especially because the next LTS of Ubuntu won't let users pip-install anything without a virtual environment. At the time of writing, this app requires `python >= 3.8` to run. Note that because of open3d, we do not support python 3.11 yet. Furthermore, support has been removed for python 3.6 and 3.7.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:ThomasByr/point-cloud-visualizer.git
cd point-cloud-visualizer
```

You can create and activate a conda environment with the following commands :

```bash
# Create the environment and install the dependencies
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate o3d
```

Finally, run the app by typing the following :

```bash
# Run app
python pcv.py -vips out/point_cloud.npy
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD051 -->

(\*) _[...] means the argument expects a value if specified ; no arguments are required for the app to run_

(\*\*) _`N` is an integer, `<=N` means "less than or equal to N", eg. `only "<=3,5-7"` will parse the first 3 entries and the entries 5, 6 and 7 (note that both "-" endpoints are included)_

## ‚öóÔ∏è Testing

Make sure you have installed the dependencies for testing :

```bash
# inside conda environment
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Then, run the tests with the following command :

```bash
hatch run dev:check
```

or more manually :

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m pylint src
python -m yapf -dr src
```

- delayed import of open3d to speed up the cli
- complete refactoring of the logging system + check for color support
- made the "=" in "<=" for `--only` optional
- added "{X}", "{Y}" and "{Z}" to the pattern for the config file
- if both "source_xyz" and "{X}", "{Y}" and "{Z}" are present, the origin takes both into account

- [ ] parallelize the point cloud loading from different files
